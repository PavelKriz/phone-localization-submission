abstract = "Efficient matching of local image features is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications. However, the real-time performance of top matching algorithms is compromised in computationally limited devices, such as mobile phones or drones, due to the simplicity of their hardware and their finite energy supply. In this paper we introduce BEBLID, an efficient learned binary image descriptor. It improves our previous real-valued descriptor, BELID, making it both more efficient for matching and more accurate. To this end we use AdaBoost with an improved weak-learner training scheme that produces better local descriptions. Further, we binarize our descriptor by forcing all weak-learners to have the same weight in the strong learner combination and train it in an unbalanced data set to address the asymmetries arising in matching and retrieval tasks. In our experiments BEBLID achieves an accuracy close to SIFT and better computational efficiency than ORB, the fastest algorithm in the literature."

abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

  abstract={There has been growing interest in the use of binary-valued features, such as BRIEF, ORB, and BRISK for efficient local feature matching. These binary features have several advantages over vector-based features as they can be faster to compute, more compact to store, and more efficient to compare. Although it is fast to compute the Hamming distance between pairs of binary features, particularly on modern architectures, it can still be too slow to use linear search in the case of large datasets. For vector-based features, such as SIFT and SURF, the solution has been to use approximate nearest-neighbor search, but these existing algorithms are not suitable for binary features. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for approximate matching of binary features, based on priority search of multiple hierarchical clustering trees. We compare this to existing alternatives, and show that it performs well for large datasets, both in terms of speed and memory efficiency.},
