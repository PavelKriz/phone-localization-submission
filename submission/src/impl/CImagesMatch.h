 * \brief      Contains class that handles matches between two object, mainly it represent the match itself
 *
 * It is designed to be used with one object (training object) and one scene (query image scene)
 * It can run with any images but it is optimised for previously mentioned usage
 * 
 * Usage is following: construct -> <probably: found which match is the best by constructing all the CImageMatch objects>
 *  -> display the match or just get information about the images in the best match
