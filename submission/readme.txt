====================THESIS====================
The thesis could be viewed in the rendered pdf format in the text directory.
The exact latex file and all files used to create the pdf file are placed in the src/thesis directory. 

====================EXECUTABLE APPLICATION====================
The "BP_Pavel_Kriz_2021.exe" executable binary file is placed in the exe directory.
The directory is already prepared in a way that the application can be run in meaningful configuration.

In the same directory is also placed the OpenCV library, which is necessary for the application to run.

The config.json file is also necessary. It serves the purpose of linking other parts of the configuration.
The default configuration files are placed in the exe/config directory.

There is also a default image database in the directory image_database, which is linked in the default configuration.

====================SOURCE CODE====================
The source code from which the executable binary was build is placed in the src/impl directory.
The source code is commented in the Doxygen style (documentation generator).
