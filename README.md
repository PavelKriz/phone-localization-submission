## Abstract
Our work is part of the Dowry Cities of Czech Queens project, which aims to bring history closer to the general public using modern technologies such as augmented reality. This is done using an application for Android mobile devices, which displays historical elements in the camera scene at runtime. This work contributes to its development by proposing a localisation solution for the application using image and geolocation data. The introduction describes and analyses potentially applicable technologies and works that preceded our work within the project. This work then specifically follows on from the bachelor's thesis Recognition and Editing of the Urban Scene. We adapted the results of the previous work for the needs of our work, in which we implemented a new more advanced prototype based on the calculation of the global position of the device. The new prototype is then tested for functionality and practical applicability with respect to the hardware capabilities of the device and compared with existing device capabilities. At the end of the work, the involvement of the prototype in the mobile application of the project is proposed and suggestions for further future development are presented.
